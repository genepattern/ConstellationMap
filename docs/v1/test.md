## Introduction

ConstellationMap helps leverage the full power of a gene set enrichment
analysis by identifying commonalities between high-scoring gene sets and
mapping their relationships. ConstellationMap visualizes in an
interactive web application the enrichment profile similarity and gene
member overlap of gene sets, which are positively or negatively enriched
in relation to a phenotype in a two-class or continuous-class
comparison. It uses provided enrichment scores (e.g., those generated
by [ssGSEAProjection](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/ssGSEAProjection))
to estimate normalized mutual information (NMI) scores and project top
scoring sets onto a circular plot with the following features:

(1) Gene sets are represented as **nodes** with radial distance to the
center reflecting positive or negative enrichment in the phenotype,
whichever direction is specified. Higher associations for the
correlation direction are plotted closer to the center.

(2) Member gene overlaps between sets are represented
as **edges** connecting nodes with thickness proportional to degree of
overlap.

(3) The angular distance between nodes is relatively proportional to the
similarity of their enrichment profiles, i.e. more similar enrichment
patterns have a smaller angular distance.

2015):** PubMed (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594333>), DOI
([10.12688/f1000research.6644.1)](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6644.1)

Web interactive features allow export of selected overlapping gene
symbols for annotation
in [DAVID](http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), [MSigDB](http://www.msigdb.org/),
and [GeneMania](http://genemania.org/). Click on the output
file *Visualizer.html* to open the interactive ConstellationMap plot
from the Jobs Tab.

  - Use mouse click on the web visualization to select a node or an
    edge. Use shift+click, or click-drag to select a group of features.
  - Selection displays gene set names, number of genes in the set,
    number of sets used to compute overlap, and overlapping member gene
    symbols.
  - Adjust number of nodes in highlighted area for which to display the
    maximum number of overlapping gene symbols.

In addition to the web application, ConstellationMap outputs two static
plots: (1) a positive red to negative blue heat map of per sample
enrichment of the gene sets ranked by NMI scores as well as Area Under
the Curve (AUC) and t-test metrics along with corresponding p-values,
and (2) a constellation map marking the phenotype of interest in the
center in red, concentric contour arcs marking association to the
phenotype (as measured by NMI), nodes as numbered open circles, overlap
as green lines, and a key of the numbered gene sets.

## Example Workflows

Users may input gene set enrichment data produced by any algorithm as
long as it is in [GCT
format](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GCT:_Gene_Cluster_Text_file_format_.28.2A.gct.29),
as well as any gene set collection
in [GMX](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMX:_Gene_MatriX_file_format_.28.2A.gmx.29) or [GMT](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) format.
For convenience, GenePattern modules including ConstellationMap provide
MSigDB gene set collection files from a drop-down menu. The two module
workflow examples presented here both use outputs from
GenePattern’s [ssGSEAProjection
module](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/ssGSEAProjection) as
inputs to ConstellationMap. Workflow (A) uses ssGSEAProjection only on
user-specified enriched sets, e.g. those previously identified from
another analysis, while Workflow (B) uses enrichment rankings computed
by ssGSEAProjection on the expression dataset in ConstellationMap. Users
may choose Workflow (A) if they have a preferred method (e.g., GSEA) for
identifying gene sets highly associated with a phenotypic class. If
users do not have a preferred method, then they may use Workflow (B),
which uses NMI to identify highly associated gene sets. See the
following figure for a visual representation of the two workflows.

![ConstellationMap Workflow
Figure](./content_constellationmap_workflow.png)

### Workflow (A)

Whole Transcriptome Expression Data → GSEA (or other gene set analysis
method) → ssGSEAProjection → ConstellationMap

1.  From a gene set enrichment analysis result using an expression
    dataset and a preferred gene set collection, e.g. a GSEA module
    analysis of RNA-Seq expression data using MSigDB’s C3 Motifs
    Collection, identify a group of interesting gene sets. For example,
    all gene sets that GSEA identified as highly enriched based on an
    FDR cutoff of 0.25. Organize the names of these gene sets exactly as
    they appear in the gene set collection into a comma-separated list
    without spaces
2.  Run the ssGSEAProjection module with the following parameter
    settings:
    1.  *input gct file*: expression dataset used in step (1)
    2.  *gene sets database (file)*: the same file or contains the same
        gene sets used in step (1) in GMX or GMT format
    3.  *gene set selection*: comma-separated list of interesting gene
        sets
    4.  *combine mode*: combine.off
3.  Run the ConstellationMap module with the following parameter
    settings:
    1.  *input gct file*: output from ssGSEAProjection in step (2)
    2.  *input cls file*: same as used in the example GSEA analysis of
        step (1)
    3.  *gene sets database (file)*: same as used in step (2)
    4.  *top n*: set to a number equal to or less than the number of
        interesting gene sets inputted at step (2c)

### Workflow (B)

Whole Transcriptome Expression Data → ssGSEAProjection →
ConstellationMap

1.  Run the ssGSEAProjection module with the following parameter
    settings:
    1.  *input gct file*: expression dataset
    2.  *gene sets database (file)*: select an MSigDB collection from
        the drop-down menu or provide a GMX or GMT file of gene sets
    3.  *gene set selection*: ALL
    4.  *combine mode*: combine.off
2.  Run the ConstellationMap module with the following parameter
    settings:
    1.  *input gct file*: output from ssGSEAProjection in step (1)
    2.  *input cls file*: CLS file containing two categorical phenotypes
        or continuous phenotypes
    3.  *gene sets database (file)*: same as used in step (1)
    4.  *top n*: set to a number equal to or less than the number of
        gene sets ssGSEAProjection identifies to be associated with the
        phenotype in the given *direction* (i.e., positive or negative).

For gene set collections that do not utilize \_UP and \_DN suffixes at
the ends of set names, the *combine mode *parameter option is irrelevant
as all the modes give the same output.

As of MSigDB v5.0, released March 2015, four collections contain gene
sets with \_UP and \_DN suffixes. These
are *C2.all*, *C2.CGP*, *C6.all*, and *C7.all*. Some gene sets,
including many in MSigDB, are derived from previous gene expression
studies with up-regulated and down-regulated genes divided into separate
gene sets denoted by an \_UP or \_DN suffix appended to otherwise
identical set names. The ssGSEAProjection module can recombine these
paired sets and calculate a combined enrichment score for each pair.
See [ssGSEAProjection module
documentation](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/ssGSEAProjection) for
more information.

For gene set collections that utilize \_UP and \_DN suffixes, set
ssGSEAProjection parameter *combine mode* to *combine.off*. Do not use
the other two options, *combine.add* or *combine.replace*, as they
create new combined gene sets that lack either suffix and which are not
represented in the input gene set collection unless you will be
providing ConstellationMap with a gene set collection that includes the
new combined gene sets. ConstellationMap requires that the gene sets
specified in the input GCT file match a subset of the gene sets
provided.

  - *Combine.replace* replaces the original paired gene sets with a new
    combined gene set and thus reduces the number of gene sets in the
    output by half the paired sets.
  - *Combine.add* mode keeps the original paired sets and independent
    scores and adds the new combined set with combined score to the
    output GCT file, increasing the number of gene sets by the number of
    paired sets.

**Note:** while the upstream GSEA, GSEAPreranked, and ssGSEAProjection
modules all permit selection of multiple gene set files, **this is
not supported by ConstellationMap at this time.** As a workaround, you
can combine the gene set files by hand and upload the single combined
file.

## Algorithm

Constellation Map operates on the provided gene set enrichment scores,
estimating the probability density functions of gene set and phenotypic
class variables using kernel density estimation. These density functions
are subsequently used to calculate normalized mutual information (NMI)
scores for each gene set, which capture the association between each
gene set’s enrichment scores and phenotypic classes (Eq. 3). Since NMI
scores do not inherently contain information on direction of
association, we apply the sign of the Pearson correlation (Eq. 4).

Next, the top N NMI-scoring gene sets are selected for projection onto
the circular space. NMI scores are calculated pairwise across the N gene
sets quantify the similarity between their enrichment profiles. These
pairwise NMI scores are converted into dissimilarity scores, *d* = 1
− *NMI*, which has been mathematically proven to be a true distance
metric. An *N*-by-*N* distance matrix *D* is constructed containing
these pairwise distances *d*.

The circular Constellation Map plot is built using the multidimensional
scaling projection R package SMACOF version 1.5–0. An angular distance
matrix Δ is calculated by minimizing the objective function (Eq. 5),
where *δ<sub>ij</sub>* is the angular distance and *d<sub>ij</sub>* is
the original distance (stored in *D*) between gene sets *i* and *j*. The
gene sets are plotted as points distributed about the origin. Angular
distance between two gene sets is determined from Δ and is proportional
to the similarity of the gene sets’ enrichment profiles. Radial distance
(i.e., distance to the origin) indicates the gene set’s association with
respect to the phenotype (1 – *NMI*).

To provide context of gene overlap between sets, pairwise Jaccard
indices are calculated across the gene sets. (The Jaccard index is equal
to the number of genes shared by two sets divided by the number of genes
in their union.) For pairs with Jaccard indices greater than a given
threshold, edges are drawn connecting the respective nodes; the
thickness of each edge is proportional to the Jaccard index.

For each sample in the corresponding expression dataset the CLS file assigns a label or numerical value for the phenotype.
- **gene sets database**
    - This drop-down menu allows you to select gene sets from the [Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)](http://www.msigdb.org/) on the GSEA website. This menu provides access to collections from MSigDB version 5.0. 
      - If you want to use files from an earlier version of MSigDB, you will need to download that file from the archived releases on the website and specify it in the gene sets file parameter. 
      - You can also upload a gene set file in [GMT](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) or [GMX](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMX:_Gene_MatriX_file_format_.28.2A.gmx.29) format. Provide your gene set file here if it is unavailable from the drop-down menu.
      - **Note:** While the upstream GSEA, GSEAPreranked, and ssGSEAProjection modules all permit selection of multiple gene set files, **this is not supported by ConstellationMap at this time.** As a workaround, you can combine the gene set files by hand and upload the single combined file.
- **gene sets file**
    - A gene set file in [GMT](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) or [GMX](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMX:_Gene_MatriX_file_format_.28.2A.gmx.29) format.

- **top n**<span style="color: red;">*</span>
    - This is a positive integer indicating the number of top NMI-scoring gene sets to display in the final plot. This parameter must be greater than 2 but less than or equal to the total number of enriched gene sets.
- **direction**<span style="color: red;">*</span>
    - This drop-down menu allows you to select the direction of correlation, “positive” or “negative”, in which ConstellationMap will investigate association to the *target class*. 
      - If “positive” is chosen then gene sets that are more positively associated with the *target class* will be placed closer to the center in the resulting radial plot. If “negative” is chosen then gene sets that are more negatively associated with the *target class* will be placed closer to the center in the resulting radial plot. 
      - Default: “positive”
- **image format**<span style="color: red;">*</span>
    - This drop-down menu allows you to select an image format for the outputted static plot and heat map, either PNG (raster graphics) or PDF (vector graphics). 
    - Default: “PNG”
- **jaccard threshold** <span style="color: red;">*</span>
    - This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the Jaccard Index threshold above which connecting edges between gene sets will be drawn in the resulting plot. 
    - ConstellationMap measures the overlap between all gene set pairs using a Jaccard Index metric. The Jaccard Index is equal to the number of genes in the intersect of the two sets divided by the number of genes in their union. 
    - Edges are drawn between gene set pairs if their Jaccard Index is greater than the threshold parameter given here. This affects both the static and interactive plots. 
    - Default: 0.1
- **target class**
    - This is a phenotype label, indicating the phenotypic category against which ConstellationMap will measure the association of various gene sets based on their enrichment. In the outputted visualization, target class will be plotted in the center of the radial plot. This parameter must match one of the two phenotype labels specified in the second line of the *input cls file*. If this parameter is left blank, ConstellationMap will default to the first listed phenotype label in the *input cls file*.
